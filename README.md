# 🧬 dna-sequence-analyzer

A Python-based toolkit for analyzing DNA sequences — from basic composition stats and reverse complements to restriction enzyme mapping and GenBank-to-FASTA conversion.  
Built as part of a bioinformatics course project to develop hands-on experience with parsing and analyzing nucleotide data.

## 📁 Required Files

- **FASTA file** (e.g., `sample.fasta`) — for sequence analysis  
- **GenBank file** (e.g., `example.gb`) — for FASTA conversion  
- **RestrictionEnzymes.txt** — enzyme name and recognition site in this format:
